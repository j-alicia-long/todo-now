# Devlog

Running log of development on the todo app (Unstuck dashboard). Newest entries first.

**Convention:** one `## YYYY-MM-DD` section per working day. Keep entries short — what shipped, key decisions, and links to commits. The longer narrative history (sessions, open questions, decisions) lives in the parent workspace's `history.md`.

## 2026-07-24 — Architecture hardening

Codebase quality pass: extracted domain logic, added tooling, deepened the data layer.

- Reworked recurrence scheduling: due dates land on the occurrence day, new `showEarlyDays` field controls Board lead time (defaults 14d long-term / 0d weekly), and completing a long-term item auto-advances its dueDate with endsOn/endsAfter enforcement ([`7b7d971`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/7b7d971))
- Decomposed TodoPage (~2,900 → ~1,225 lines) into `src/components/`: shared UI primitives and presentation helpers, then Board cards, then list rows and settings; components with 3+ callbacks take narrow action-handle objects (`TaskActions`, `RecurringCardActions`, `ShoppingItemActions`, …) instead of prop drilling ([`68080f7`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/68080f7))
- Extracted Week & recurrence rules into a pure shared domain module `src/domain/recurrence.ts` with injected clock, 36 tests ([`5c5fd2a`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/5c5fd2a))
- Documented the stores layer in AGENTS.md ([`7e4ccf8`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/7e4ccf8))
- Per-family store hooks to deepen the client data seam ([`ed8d718`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/ed8d718))
- ESLint + pre-commit hooks (husky, lint-staged, prettier); fixed all lint errors ([`f540c86`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/f540c86), [`0a58054`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/0a58054))
- Extracted Task lifecycle rules into a shared domain module ([`ed0ee22`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/ed0ee22))
- Added CONTEXT.md domain glossary and first ADR ([`7f87092`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/7f87092))
- Removed Small Win feature ([`c338076`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/c338076)); added deployment instructions ([`1179da6`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/1179da6)); shopping list item links ([`5415bd8`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/5415bd8))

## 2026-07-16 — Recurring tab buildout & polish

Iterated the Recurring tab into its settled form.

- Two-column layout, edit modal, recurrence picker, Done column ([`336b26c`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/336b26c))
- Simplified fields (dropped priority/effort/decision), added due date & area, auto-sort long-term section ([`1aa7096`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/1aa7096))
- Visual cleanup: neutral columns, purple events theme ([`1f1bc8a`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/1f1bc8a), [`0a13055`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/0a13055))
- Mobile fixes: scroll, hidden tab labels, modal form ([`8bce007`](https://github.com/j-alicia-long/todo-now/commit/8bce007))

## 2026-07-15 — Shopping board, Recurring tab, UI theme
